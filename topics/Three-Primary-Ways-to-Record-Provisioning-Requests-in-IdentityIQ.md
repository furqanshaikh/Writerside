# Three Primary Ways to Record Provisioning Requests in IdentityIQ

### Three Primary Ways to Record Provisioning Requests in IdentityIQ

The sources list five ways to record provisioning requests in IdentityIQ:

*   **Certifications:** Certifications are periodic reviews of user access where reviewers can revoke or modify entitlements that are no longer needed. All revocations and provisioning requests from an access review are grouped into a single provisioning plan and processed collectively. However, certifications with the "Process Revokes Immediately" option process revocations right away.
*   **Policy Violations:** When IdentityIQ policies detect inconsistencies in an identity's access, it flags them as violations. The violation owner, often the identity's manager or application owner, can either grant an exception or initiate a remediation request. IdentityIQ offers various types of remediation requests, such as disabling the account, removing the entitlement, removing the identity from a group, or removing the role.
*   **Identity-Refresh-Driven Assignments:**  Identity Refresh tasks can generate provisioning requests by applying role assignment rules and examining role detection profiles.  This can involve adding roles to identity cubes or creating provisioning requests for external applications.
*   **Lifecycle Manager Requests:**  Lifecycle Manager, a separately licensed component of IdentityIQ, streamlines entitlement management through provisioning requests.  Users, depending on their role and system configuration, can request access for themselves or others. The sources provide an example where managers can request access for their direct reports, help desk users can request access for themselves and others, and any user can request access for themselves. The sources specify that Lifecycle Manager requests can be used for actions like adding an entitlement to a specific identity, revoking an identity's current entitlements, creating a new IdentityIQ identity, modifying attributes for existing IdentityIQ identities, resetting passwords on target systems, and viewing identities.
*   **Lifecycle Event-Driven Provisioning:** When Lifecycle Manager is enabled, Lifecycle Events, such as joining the company, changing departments, or leaving the company, can trigger workflows containing provisioning actions. These events initiate business processes that can include provisioning actions. Provisioning plans can also be generated when attribute values are edited, account links are deleted or moved, or capabilities and scopes are changed.

The three primary ways to record provisioning requests in IdentityIQ are: **Lifecycle Manager requests**, **certifications**, and **policy violations**. While Identity-Refresh-Driven Assignments and Lifecycle Event-Driven Provisioning can also generate provisioning requests, they are generally considered secondary methods within the context of the provided sources.
